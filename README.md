# Le Creus'torza

### About this project

In a team of 5 Wild Code School's students, we had 5 weeks to developp a movie recommendation engine.
For the context, a theater in the Creuse region on the verge of bankruptcy asked us for a tool to recommend movies to their customers.
Directly inspired by the mythical Katorza in Nantes and its absurd sessions, we have come up with a new kind of film recommendation engine!
The algorithm will recommend films similar to your favourite one under different categories: dull version, recent, known... We let you discover all this!

By Anna Munos, Robin Sainsot, Manoa Brugger, St√©phane Provost and Charles Girouard.

### Dataset used

We used the IMDb base at the starting point : 
https://datasets.imdbws.com

But we did some modifications : we only kept the movies which were released in France, we deleted some genre such as "TV-Reality", "Adult", or "News", and we deleted the movies that had missing datas.
